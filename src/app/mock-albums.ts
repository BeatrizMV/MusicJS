    id:1, details:{title: "Talkin' Verve: Roots of Acid Jazz", style: ["Hard Bop", "Soul Jazz"], release_date: "1996", cover_img:"0001_talkin_verve_roots_of_acid_jazz.jpg", description:"Designed to appeal to hip-hop and acid jazz fans, not jazz purists, Talkin' Verve: Roots of Acid Jazz collects 14 tracks Jimmy Smith cut for Verve during the late '60s. Comprised of pop covers and funky workouts, the music is 'jazzy', not jazz -- there's little improvisation on the record, but there is a lot of hot vamping, with Smith creating dense, funky chord clusters and bluesy leads. It's music that is devoted to the groove, and while a few of these cuts fall flat -- 'Ode to Billie Joe' has no funk in it, no matter how hard you try -- but for the most part Talkin' Verve is soulful fun. Not much of this sounds like acid jazz, especially since the rhythms are a little stiff, but it's enjoyable lite funk, and it's more palatable in the compilation than it is on their original albums."}},
    {id:2, details:{title: "Peel Slowly and See - Disc 2", style: ["Styles Experimental Rock", "Proto-Punk", "Folk-Rock", "Psychedelic-Garage"], release_date: "26 de septiembre de 1995", cover_img: "0001_peel_slowly_and_see_d1.jpg",description: "Does this five-CD box set feature an abundance of essential material? Certainly. It has all four of the studio albums released by the Lou Reed-led lineup, and a wealth of previously unreleased goodies. Is it an essential purchase? That depends on your level of fanaticism. Most serious Velvet fans have all four of the core studio albums already (although the third, self-titled LP is presented in its muffled, so-called 'closet' mix), and will be most interested in the previously unavailable recordings, which do hold considerable fascination. The entire first disc is devoted to a drummer-less 1965 rehearsal tape in John Cale's loft, with radically different, almost folky run-throughs of most of the important songs from their classic debut, as well as a song that only made it onto Nico's first LP ('Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams'), and one which makes its first appearance anywhere (the Dylanesque 'Prominent Men'). Other big bonuses include no less than seven outtakes from Loaded and other songs re-done by Reed on his early solo albums. And there are sundry other unreleased live and studio items, highlighted by a scorching live 1967 'Guess I'm Falling in Love' and the 1969 demo 'Countess From Hong Kong'. There are also highlights from VU and Another View, longer versions of Loaded's 'Sweet Jane' and 'New Age', and an 80-page booklet. The thing is, though, that virtually everyone who's interested in this material has already bought the four studio albums, sometimes several times over. A separate release of the two discs or so of truly new material would have been welcomed by the many fans who aren't interested in paying for a five-CD box of stuff when they already have well over half of it."}},

    {id:7, details:{title: "Starboy", style: ["Alternative R&B", "Dance-Pop"], release_date: "25 de noviembre de 2016", cover_img: "0001_starboy.jpg",description: "The extent of the 2015 Weeknd commercial rebound, symbolized by platinum certifications for Beauty Behind the Madness and all four of its singles, didn't merely embolden Abel Tesfaye. On this follow-up's fourth track, a blithe midtempo cut where Tesfaye takes a swipe at pretenders while boasting about drinking codeine out of one of his trophies, the level of success is a source of amusement. He notes the absurdity in taking a 'kids' show' award for 'Can't Feel My Face,' in which he was 'talkin' 'bout a face numbin' off a bag of blow.' The track actually lost to Adele's 'Hello,' but it clearly, somewhat comically, reached an unintended demographic. It comes as no surprise that Tesfaye, on his third proper album, doesn't attempt to optimize the reach of his biggest hit by consciously targeting youngsters. He sings of being a 'Starboy' with access to a fleet of sports cars, but he's a 'motherfuckin' starboy,' one who is 26 years old and proud to observe his woman snort cocaine off his fancy table. While Starboy often reflects an increased opulence in the personal and professional aspects of Tesfaye's life -- from more upscale pronouns to expensive collaborations with the likes of Daft Punk (two) and 'Can't Feel My Face' producers Max Martin and Ali Payami (four) -- the dark moments of vulnerability are pitch black. Lines like 'I switch up my cup, I kill any pain' could have come from Tesfaye's mixtape debut, yet there are new levels of torment. In 'Ordinary Life,' he considers driving off a Mulholland Drive cliff, James Dean style, wishing he could swap everything for angel status. It's followed with 'Nothing Without You,' a ballad of toxic dysfunction. He asks his lover if she'd feel guilty for not answering his call if he happened to die that night. It's not all dread and depravity. There's some sense of joy in a one-night stand, and an echo of 'Say Say Say' Michael Jackson, on the Luomo-ish house track 'Rockin'.' Contrition is shown in the slick retro-modern disco-funk of 'A Lonely Night.' Ironically enough, in the aching 'True Colors,' Tesfaye sounds a little insecure about a lover's past. The album's lighter, comparatively sweeter parts -- the Tears for Fears-sampling/Romantics-referencing 'Secrets' and the breezy and only slightly devilish 'I Feel It Coming' among them -- are all welcome highlights. At 18 tracks, the album is a 'contracted edition' playlist toolkit. The songwriting credits list just under 40 composers, and the productions -- the majority of which involve Doc McKinney and/or Cirkut, low-lighted by maneater dance-punk dud 'False Alarm' -- are roughly as variable in style as they are in quality. When pared down to its ten best songs, Starboy sounds like Tesfaye's most accomplished work."}},
    {id:8, details:{title: "Translation", style: ["Latin Pop", "Pop", "Pop-Rap"], release_date: "19 de junio de 2020", cover_img: "0001_Translation.png",description: "On top of the music world for much of the 2000s, pop-rap group Black Eyed Peas impacted the global charts and became an indelible part of the mainstream with their crowd-pleasing electro-hip-pop hybrid anthems that would provide the soundtrack to school dances, weddings, and sporting events for years to come. Following the 2010 release of their sixth album, The Beginning, they went silent, releasing just one other LP that decade, a throwback to their '90s rap roots that abandoned the disposable pop candy of their peak popularity period (as well as longtime vocalist Fergie). Despite that album's sincerity, depth, and urgent societal messages, Masters of the Sun failed to capture much attention and the group quickly pivoted back to familiar territory for their next effort. Placing their conscious hip-hop hearts back in the vault, the core Peas (will.i.am, apl.de.ap, Taboo) and new recruit J. Rey Soul (whose vocals echo Fergie's in a very calculated fashion) set their sights on the mainstream once again with 2020's Translation, another stylistic shift that brought the Peas into the world of Latin pop and back to the dancefloor where they belong. Playing like an extended club set, the album slides seamlessly from track to track, maintaining the increased heart rate and hypnotic energy alongside a who's who from the Latin pop world. Colombian reggaeton king J Balvin joins them on their first platinum certification since the waning days of their peak period with 'Ritmo,' while Puerto Rico's Ozuna assists with another radio hit on 'Mamacita.' The party traverses across continents with Maluma, Shakira, Nicky Jam, Becky G, French Montana, and more, who each trade verses with the Peas atop will.i.am's ever-spotless production and inspired sampling choices. In addition to interpolating Corona's 1993 Euro-dance crossover smash 'Rhythm of the Night' on 'Ritmo,' he later mines past favorites from Madonna, Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam, Miami Sound Machine, MC Hammer, and La Bouche to maximum effect. As intentional and obvious as it is, these studio tricks hit the mark, providing a satisfying and nostalgic distraction from the world with addictive earworms designed to dance one's cares away. The only time the Peas allow reality to infiltrate the mix is on 'News Today,' a sobering summary of the headline-grabbing ills plaguing society in 2020, from the COVID-19 pandemic to systemic racism and police brutality. Fortunately, the track arrives once the dance party concludes, harshing none of the buzz that they've carefully crafted on the 14 preceding songs. Throbbing and covered in sweat, Translation is unapologetic in its intent and a surprisingly welcome reminder of the Peas' power to lift spirits not through socially conscious bars, but internationally appealing, borderless people-pleasing that unites through dance."}}
